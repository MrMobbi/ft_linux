# Linux From Scratch (LFS)

## Introduction

In this project, I will build a **Linux From Scratch** system. 
This involves creating our own partition and downloading all the necessary packages from scratch. 
The process will provide a comprehensive understanding of how to assemble a Linux operating system tailored to our specific needs.

## Overview

**Linux From Scratch (LFS)** is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system from scratch. 
The LFS book guides you through the process of assembling a functional Linux operating system by compiling and installing all the necessary software and libraries.

### Toolchain

The toolchain is a crucial component in the LFS build process. 
It refers to a set of programming tools used to create a software application, including compilers, linkers, and libraries. 
In LFS, the toolchain consists of two main parts: the **cross-toolchain**, which is built in a temporary environment and is used to compile the final system's binaries, 
and the **final toolchain**, which is used for building and installing the essential system components. 
Understanding and correctly configuring the toolchain ensures that the software is built efficiently and correctly, allowing the system to operate as intended.

## Features

- **Customization**: Build a Linux system tailored to your specific needs and preferences.
- **Learning Experience**: Gain a deep understanding of how a Linux system works by manually configuring and compiling each component.
- **Control**: Have complete control over the software versions and configurations used in your system.
- **Minimalism**: Start with a minimal base system and add only what you need.

## Getting Started

To get started with Linux From Scratch, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A working Linux system or a virtual machine.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line usage.
- At least 20 GB of free disk space (recommended).
- Internet connection for downloading source packages.

### Steps to Build Your Own LFS System

1. **Download the LFS Book**: Access the latest version of the LFS book from the [LFS website](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/download.html).
2. **Prepare Your Environment**: Create a new partition or use an existing one to install LFS. Set up necessary tools (like `bash`, `make`, etc.) in your host system.
3. **Follow the Book**: Follow the instructions in the LFS book closely. Each chapter will guide you through installing various packages and configuring your system.
4. **Build the Toolchain**: Compile and install the essential tools needed for building your LFS system.
5. **Install the Base System**: Install the basic system components, including the Linux kernel and essential libraries.
6. **Configure the System**: Configure your new system to meet your requirements (e.g., set up networking, user accounts, etc.).
7. **Boot Your LFS System**: Reboot into your new Linux From Scratch system!
